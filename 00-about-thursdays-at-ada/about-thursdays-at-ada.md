# Thursdays at Ada

While in Internship students return on Thursdays for additional learning on Computer Science Fundamentals and career development.

## CS Fundamentals

In Computer Science fundamentals students learn the following concepts and data structures:

- [Code Reviews](../01-Code-Reviews/01-code-reviews.md)
- [Linked Lists](../02-linked-lists/02-linked-lists.md)
- [Binary Search Trees](../03-Binary-Search-Trees/01-Binary-Search-Trees.md)
- [Stacks](../04-Stacks-And-Queues/01-stacks-and-queues.md)
- [Queues](../04-Stacks-And-Queues/01-stacks-and-queues.md)
- [Hash Tables](../05-hash-tables/01-hash-tables.md)
- [Heaps](../06-heaps/01-heaps.md)
- [Alogorithm categories](../07-algorithms/algorithms.md) such as Divide & Conquer, Dynamic Programming and Greedy Algorithms.
- [Graphs](../08-graphs/graphs.md)

### Reverse Classroom

CS Fundamentals is taught in a [flipped-classroom](https://omerad.msu.edu/teaching/teaching-strategies/27-teaching/162-what-why-and-how-to-implement-a-flipped-classroom-model) style.  Students are assigned a week prior to review a markdown lesson with accompanying video lesson and slides.  Then in class or online session students ask questions review concepts and work on exercises.  Students are also given time to work toward a weekly programming project.

### CS Fun Recorded Sessions

All the CS Fundamentals Online sessions are recorded in Panopto.
